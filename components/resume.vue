                        Vitenskap is a technological consultancy firm founded by Diego Márquez, a computer science engineer and me. Since the beginning of the company we developed some iOS and android applications for a number of clients, but 2 of our most greatest achievements were the infrastructure, hardware and software development of a project proposal with a live demostration of an IoT people tracker project developed for a private company which is going to be implemented in a security program in the state of Colima, México. The second is the development of a software solution for an oncologic and parenteral nutritions mix center management system, this was a new center and we were deeply involved in the process from conception to deployment. We were able to obtain all the certification for operation and it been operational for 1 year, we are under constant development of new function and mantainance with the client and we have recently being reached out by an external company with interest to acquire a sotware license.

                        I am an associate professor of Faculty of Engineering of the university teaching biomedical instrumentation courses. I started my academic career developing an analogic and digital filters and microcontrollers course, then I was offered to develop the biomedical intrumentation and control course and then the 2 more advanced courses biomedical measurements I and II. The university offeren me the opportunity to coordinate hospital internships for 15 students among private hospitals and National Health Institutes, I was also in charge of the management of the projects developed by the students in association with the heads of biomedical engineer departments. I have been advisor of the undergraduate degree dissertation of 2 students and mentored research projects of more than 15 students, one of them lead to my student to be accepted to undertake a summer research internship in the University of New Mexico.
